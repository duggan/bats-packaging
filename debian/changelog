bats (0.4.0) precise; urgency=low

  * Improved the display of failing test cases. Bats now shows the
    source code of failing test lines, along with full stack traces
    including function names, filenames, and line numbers.
  * Improved the display of the pretty-printed test summary line to
    include the number of skipped tests, if any.
  * Improved the speed of the preprocessor, dramatically shortening test
    and suite startup times.
  * Added support for absolute pathnames to the `load` helper.
  * Added support for single-line `@test` definitions.
  * Added bats(1) and bats(7) manual pages.
  * Modified the `bats` command to default to TAP output when the `$CI`
    variable is set, to better support environments such as Travis CI.
